# ProjectFTH
Project FTH (Free The Helpless) is as attempt to recognize people who are enslaved as sex slaves by comparing photos and videos of them pre-abduction to actors and actresses in pornographic videos. The hope is to use the FBI's "This is how they'd look today" prediction software to help identify even those who have been missing for several years.
